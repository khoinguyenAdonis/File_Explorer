## File System Explorer ##

The application is designed to be straightforward, allowing users to:

View the contents of directories.
Navigate into subdirectories.

The screenshot provided shows a preview version of the explorer running on Debian 12 x86_64. This serves as a preliminary testbed for the ultimate goal: developing and deploying versions tailored for ARM-based systems to serve lightweight embedded environments.
